# custom-playback-loop

## DOCUMENTATION

#### Purpose:
You set the time you want to loop a youtube video!

#### Clarification: #### 
While I use the words "hack" in my code, this is by no means a hack. Just a simple, personal solution to a problem I faced.

#### Steps:
1. Download the custom loop (youtube).txt file
2. Set the `hack` variables (hackMin, hackRMin, etc.) that are right on top of the file.
3. Copy & paste the new code onto your browser's `console` (for chrome, right click->inspect->change tab to console->paste)
4. Hit `enter` and enjoy!
  
#### Drawbacks/Warnings:
- You need to paste the code everytime you reload the page. These are edits you make to the local copy of the website. Each reload loads the website from Youtube, which does not store the edits you made.
- The code uses class names to identify your video. If youtube ever changes that in the future this code may be useless. In the same manner this code is useless on pages other than youtube.
